Housing is one of the necessities of human life, and demand is increasing day by day. It is now essential to predict house prices as accurately as possible. The price is dependent on various factors while predicting. House prediction is useful for not only buyers and sellers but also helps in maintaining the economy of the region. The main aim of this project is to predict the sale prices of residential houses in Ames, Iowa. For achieving our purpose, we are using the dataset provided on Kaggle for training and testing purposes.

The accuracy can be increased by using neural networks and doing some more preprocessing
